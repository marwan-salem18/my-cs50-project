#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/YyD5DhGGhto
#### Description: this is a youtube like web app using flask and jinja it has a few featrues with we will go deep in starting with layout with is the overall layout.html for the haeder and footer with contains the bootstrap links and the meta stuff and the header with contains the website name and the links to the different pages such as: upload and your videos and a search form and the login logout reigester and change paswword.
#### then there is the index page with shows all the videos uploaded into the site it is not the best desigend and has scalability isuues but it will work for a small website.
#### there is also the Database with has two tables users and videos in this app videos are saved using their id and are saved iside the static folder along with the thumbnail and the database has the links to both i choose this over saving the videos in the database cause it would make the database slow and unrealiable there is also the title which saves the title of the videos 
#### we will now check the upload.html page which is a simple form that asks for 2 files 1 is the video the other is the thumbnail you can input three extenstions for thumbnails (jpg,png,jpeg) but only one for videos(mp4).
#### in app.py in the upload function we can see the files getting proccesed and saved inside the static file and then their path is extracted and goes inside the database.
#### then we go into the videoplayer with in pc shows the video at the right of the screen and the other videos in the left where as in mobile the video fill the screen and the other videos are underneath it there is a loop that shows the other videos 
#### in the app.py videoplayer function it gets the name of the video using the link from index.html or search.html or video.html or even itself it takes it as get so you can send the link and it will send you to the video immediately it also check for the existence of a video with the searched id and send an error if it doesn't exist.
#### then there is the login.html which is a simple form that takes two input and checks for them in the app.py login function and reads the user session if it exists and there is also logout with just clear the user seesion from the browser.
#### then there is the register.html page which is a form that takes three values username password and confrim of password it then checks in app.py in the register function for the existense of the user name, the password and confirmation and the exsitance of all three and then uses session to get the a user into a session using an id and saving user info and id inside the users database.
#### then there is the change password function which is also a form with four inputs username,old password,new password,confirm new password it then checks in the app.py password function if the username is correct and if the old password is correct and if the new password is the same as the confirmation it then updates the database password with the new one 
#### there is the search .html which i actually don't know why i didn't just reuse the index instead of making a new page that looks the exact same but i already did so i won't change it most of it happens in app.py search function where it takes the value from the sarech par and % and the start and of that value so it can be searched for using LIKE operater inside the database
#### and lastly there is the your videos tab with shows you your videos along with a big delete button with when clicked send a post request to videos and then gets the deleted video via id and the deletes whats inside the videos and also delets the thumbnails and then delets everything about the video in the database.
#### there is also error.html with just prints out whatever error it got send in a large font.
